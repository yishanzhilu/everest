# A Hex Example

https://github.com/Holmes89/hex-example

This is a sample project that was originally supposed to be and example of hexagonal architecture. It has slowly evolved to incorporate other ideas and product integrations.

It is a really simple ticket management API. You can create and fetch ticket (that's it). The application is flexible in that it can run as either a AWS Lambda function or a standalong server. It also allows you to swap backend database (between Redis or Postgres).
